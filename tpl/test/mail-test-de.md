If you have questions, do not hesitate to contact us:  
mailto:private-debt-survey@zew.de.


The main objective of the ZEW Private Debt Survey ({{.Link}}) is to enhance the knowledge of market
participants about the European
private debt market. The survey refers to your Corporate Direct Lending, Real Estate Debt, and Infrastructure Debt
investments and addresses quantitative and qualitative aspects of your investments and the respective investment
strategy. It also contains questions about the overall market environment.


We would appreciate your participation in this survey. With your answers, you contribute to the collection of
richer data about private credit investments that will support investors to make qualified investment decisions. As a participant, you will receive a detailed report with aggregated and anonymous survey results after each survey has been conducted.


Of course, we will treat all responses to this survey as strictly confidential and in compliance with the GDPR. We will only pass on aggregated, anonymized responses to our cooperation partner Prime Capital AG, who will write the report.
Only if you give your explicit consent, we will also pass on your individual answers to Prime Capital AG in a non-anonymized form. 

In this case, no personal data is passed on to Prime Capital AG, only the company name and the answers given in the survey.
